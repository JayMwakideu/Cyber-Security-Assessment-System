- Mobile/Web Apps
- APIs
- Firewalls
- Phishing Drills
- Maturity Analysis
- NIST Compliance
- Asset Inventory
- Access Control
- Network Security
- Incident Response

---

## ‚≠ê Features

- Generates detailed cybersecurity reports with **visual pie charts** and **histograms**
- Supports **individual** and **overall assessment** reports
- Provides **actionable recommendations** to improve security posture
- Includes **PDF export** functionality for easy sharing
- Tracks **compliance status** and **trends over time**

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Django 4.2.7**
- **Git**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the system locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/JayMwakideu/Cyber-Security-Assessment-System.git
cd Cyber-Security-Assessment-System

## **2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


## **3. Install Dependencies**


pip install -r requirements.txt


## **4. Set Up Environment Variables**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`):


cp .env.example .env


Then edit `.env` with your **Django secret key** and **database configuration**.

## **5. Run Migrations**


python manage.py migrate


## **6. Create a Superuser (for admin access)**




## **7. Start the Development Server**


python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080


## **Access the Application**

Open your browser and go to:
**[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**

Log in with the superuser credentials to access the dashboard at:
**/dashboard/**

## **Usage**

* **Log In**: Use the superuser account or sign up via `/signup/`
* **Dashboard**: Navigate to `/dashboard/` to view an overview of assessments, compliance percentages, and trends
* **Reports**: Go to `/report-menu/` and select an organization and report type (e.g., `/report/1/overall/`)
* **Download**: Use the **"Download PDF"** button on report pages to export reports

## **Future Developments: Vulnerability Assessment Expansion**

Upcoming features will expand the system‚Äôs vulnerability assessment capabilities to include:

URL, IP, and Hash Scanning: Paste URLs, IP addresses, and file hashes for analysis through integrations with VirusTotal and other threat intelligence platforms.

Mobile App Analysis: Upload APK (Android) and iOS apps for automated assessment of security issues, permissions, and embedded threats.

Firewall Exposure Testing: Scan public firewall configurations and ports to detect exposure risks and misconfigurations.

Public-Facing Services Testing: Identify exposed assets and services like web servers, APIs, databases, and IoT devices.

TLS/SSL Certificate Checks: Validate certificate strength, expiry, and implementation issues.

CMS Vulnerability Checks: Automatically detect known CVEs in CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress, Joomla).

Cloud Security Evaluation: Assess public cloud buckets, IAM policies, and open storage configurations.

Vulnerability Assessment Form: Download a standard PDF form to conduct manual or offline assessments.
